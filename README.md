Caches:

This module contains python codes to generate assembly files for testing the data cache of the Chromite Core developed by InCore Semiconductors.

Here we test the following:
       1. Fill the cache completely based on the size mentioned in the core64.yaml input
       2. Try to fill the fill-buffer completely.
       3. Perform a load/store hit in the Fill-buffer.
